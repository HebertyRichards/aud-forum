The surname \"Auditore\" was inspired by the game Assassin's Creed; I thought it was really cool and decided to name the group after it.",
      "description2": "From the beginning, I always had a very clear vision of what I wanted for Auditore. My goal was to create a group different from others at the time: something more organized and with a different approach. I observed the families of the time with 4 founders, 5 owners, 3 sub-owners and thought: \"This doesn't make any sense. It's too messy.\" Many times, they created a family, but instead of valuing their own, they ended up flattering guys from other families and became just supporting characters, without relevance. With Auditore, I wanted to do things differently. Yes, we are - different. Auditore was created to be independent and not just another one."

If you entered the game and saw Auditore is Grove, stick with Grove. Damn, we giving our lives in the Grove war and you stick with Vagos? Where's the common sense? This is disunited people attitude.

Say: 'Look, I'm leaving Auditore for this reason' or simply you don't even need to say the reason, just say: \"I'm leaving the family for personal reasons, thanks for the opportunity\". Just don't make up excuses to leave, because it's very obvious and it will look bad for you. If you leave, leave with your head held high, without lies or fights with anyone."
